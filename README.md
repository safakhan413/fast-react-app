We'll build a FastAPI backend application with the following features:

OAuth2 Authentication: Secure API endpoints using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
CORS Support: Allow cross-origin requests from your frontend.
MySQL Integration: Store and manage data using a MySQL database.
RESTful API Endpoints: Provide endpoints to retrieve records by phone number, voicemail, user ID, and cluster ID within a specified date range.
Logging: Implement robust logging for monitoring and debugging.
Data Migration: Migrate data from a JSON file (documents.json) to the MySQL database.
